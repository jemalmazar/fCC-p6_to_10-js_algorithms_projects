# freeCodeCamp: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects 6-10

View deployed web page at: https://jemalmazar.github.io/fCC-p6_to_10-js_algorithms_projects/

### Project Description

A webpage where users can check for palindromes, convert integers to Roman numerals, encode with a cipher, and validate phone number formats.

### Tools and Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Grid + Flexbox)
- JavaScript
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

### What I Learned

- the use of `min-length` and `max-length` attributes on `<input>` to inform users on acceptable string lengths
- the use of `min` and `max` attributes on `<input type="number">` to limit the range of acceptable numbers
- the proper use of `role` attributes on elements for accessibility
- the proper use of `aria` attributes like `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, `aria-labelledby`, and `aria-hidden
- the use of `gap` property to give space between elements
- the use of `text-underline-offset` property to give the text some space when using `text-decoration: underline;`
- how to use modules to organize JavaScript code

### Project Epilogue

freeCodeCamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures certificate doesn't get students to build a webpage for their final projects. Instead, one writes algorithms that pass each project's testing environment. After completing those algorithms, I wanted to showcase them on a simple webpage.

Initially, I was very excited after designing an accordion to tabs component in Figma. As I moved into writing the code, I felt like I had designed something I couldn't build. I stepped away from the project multiple times before buckling down and finally finding as solution.

I settled on an accordion that utilizes `scrollHeight` transitions. It looks great for the accordion but soon realized that that approach wasn't so great for the tabs. This project started to feel *cursed* and I briefly thought about throwing in the towel and moving onto building something else. Even after feeling like I wasted time with a poor implementation, I stuck with it and got the project to a state where I was content with the end product.

Overall, it was a challenging project that pushed me to learn new Javascript concepts, in addition to new HTML and CSS tricks.
